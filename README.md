## 🚀 About Me

I’m a CS student focused on **game development and engine programming**.  
I enjoy building systems from scratch — rendering pipelines, input handling, scene management, and gameplay mechanics — along with using pre-built engines.

Currently working on:
- Custom **C++ 2D Game Engine** and **Lite Level Editor**
- Gameplay systems & rendering pipelines
- Strengthening data structures, math, and performance optimization
